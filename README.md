# A-Frame locomotion
This project contains components for A-Frame that enable various forms of locomotion in VR. Currently only smooth locomotion and snap turning are implemented, but different modes are planned. Besides the actual modes of locomotion, there will be auxillary components that relate to locomotion (e.g. blinkers/vignette support)

# Planned features
Basic smooth locomotion and snap turning have been implemented. However there are still many facets of locomotion that are missing. Since I primarily develop this library for my own needs, the below list of planned features can change at any point.

* [x] Smooth locomotion
* [x] Snap turning
* [ ] Smooth turning
* [ ] Blinkers/vignette
* [ ] Nav-mesh support
* [ ] Teleport
* [ ] Flying
* [ ] Head-collision prevention
